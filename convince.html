     <div id="first">
       
  <p> Lip balms contain a type of microplastic that actually dries out the lips. Many big companies put these microplastics in their products in order for there to be profit through repurchasing. Microplastics are small plastics that are not able to be seen by the human eye. They are a type of pollution that is harmful overtime if exposure runs long. This is a controversy that has only recently been exposed to the public. Not all brands are unethical, but a majority of them are more entitled to making profit for economic reasons. Lip balms from certain companies do not work and the more exotically labeled, the less convienent.

    <h2> Now what? </h2>
     </div>
       
       
     <div id="first">
  <p> Lip balms that do work include ones that have natural ingredients such as beeswax or petroleum. People should try to invest in a healthier product with more natural ingredients. Any type of product with added chemicals will actually wear down your lips. There is a unlikely chance that big corporations will stop incorporating microplastics, whether it be on purpose or not, due to their own convinence. People should be aware of what ingredients are in their products or try purchasing cosmetics with natural ingredients that are safe for consumption.
